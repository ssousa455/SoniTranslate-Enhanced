Simply click the button above to start dubbing directly in your Google Colab!

## Improvements over the original SoniTranslate:

* **Guaranteed Data Security:** Your dubbed files are automatically copied to your Google Drive, even if Colab is interrupted. :smiley:
* **Faster Installation and Execution:** The program restarts significantly faster after Colab shuts down.


## Prerequisites:

* A Google account.
* A Hugging Face access token (will be requested during execution in Colab).


## How to Use:

1. Click the "Open In Colab" button above.
2. Provide your Hugging Face access token when prompted.
3. Wait for the process to complete.  The dubbed files will be saved in `/content/SoniTranslate/outputs` and copied to your "Dubbing" folder in Google Drive.
