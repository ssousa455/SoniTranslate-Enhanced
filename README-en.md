This project enhances the excellent [SoniTranslate](https://github.com/R3gm/SoniTranslate) for video dubbing, offering an even simpler and safer experience in Google Colab.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ssousa455/SoniTranslate-Enhanced/blob/main/SoniTranslate-Enhanced.ipynb)

Just click the button above to start the program directly in your Google Colab!

## Improvements over the original SoniTranslate:

* **Guaranteed Data Security:** Your dubbed files are automatically copied to your Google Drive, even if Colab is interrupted. :smiley:

* **Faster Installation and Execution:** The program restarts significantly faster after Colab closes.


## Prerequisites:

* A Google account.
* A Hugging Face access token (will be requested during execution in Colab).


## How to Use:

1. Click the "Open In Colab" button above.
2. Provide your Hugging Face access token when prompted.
3. **IMPORTANT:** After installing the dependencies (cell 2), you will need to re-run this cell to ensure that all dependencies are correctly loaded and any potential conflicts are resolved.
4. Wait for the process to complete. The dubbed files will be saved in `/content/SoniTranslate/outputs` and copied to your "Dubbing" folder in Google Drive.
